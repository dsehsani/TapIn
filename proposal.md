## Elevator Pitch
How many of you regularly read Aggie News or your local newspaper?

Our app is designed to bring local communities together, starting with towns like Davis, by making local news more engaging and accessible. We combine trusted local journalism with free, New York Times–style games that are not hidden behind a paywall. Players compete on local leaderboards with friends and neighbors, turning staying informed into something social, fun, and community driven.
